# Alphabate-R


In this repository, we leveraged the power of R programming to develop a technique that aids in the selection of the most important features from our dataset. It is well-known that a balanced dataset is crucial for obtaining unbiased outputs. Therefore, we implemented two feature selection techniques: 1] Gini impurity and 2] Entropy. By employing these methods, we are able to identify the key features that significantly contribute to our analysis.

Additionally, we recognized the significance of data balancing and utilized the z-score method to address this concern. The z-score method allows us to standardize the dataset and ensure that each feature contributes proportionally to the analysis, thus eliminating biases that may arise from imbalanced data.

For a more comprehensive understanding of our approach and its outcomes, we encourage you to refer to the detailed report associated with this repository.
